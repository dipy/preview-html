Greetings, everyone!
The sixth week of GSOC has been a hectic one. A ton of time in correcting errors and fixing PRs. 

Decorator PR Fixes
------------------

With Decorator Implementation PRs in place, and the integration of my original PR for keyword (https://github.com/dipy/dipy/pull/3239), it was now time for the PRs which had decorator implementation for specific module to be integrated.

Lazy Loading PR
---------------

I have submitted a PR for the Lazy Loading feature using the lazy_loader package. (https://github.com/dipy/dipy/pull/3288)

Difficulties & Challenges
-------------------------

I had and have a ton of Challenges ahead as I am having trouble with some PR, I am specifically having a challenge in completing:
1. https://github.com/dipy/dipy/pull/3257
- This PR, has issues related to `wls_fit_tensor` function, after the application of the decorator, I am receiving an error where it is telling me hat 3 positional arguments are allowed but 4 are being passed, but when I check the main function parameters, there are only 3 positional params, I am not able to figure why 1 extra arg is being passed.
2. https://github.com/dipy/dipy/pull/3254
- This PR, I have a question about the application of arguments separator, I am just awaiting response on applying the seperator.
3. https://github.com/dipy/dipy/pull/3288
- This PR is my lazy loading PR, I am having trouble with the application of `type_stub` as the package is not able to recognise it and thus I am receiving error in importing the modules correctly. I was trying to make it as close as possible to scikit-image implementation, it hasn't happened yet. But I'm hopeful.

Next Week
---------

Next week I am planning to push through the remaining PRs of decorator implementation. Also for lazy_loader, I am planning to fix the error.
I will have to go through the `PEP-561` documentation which talks about the `type_stub` implementation.

Final Thoughts
--------------

The sixth week of the Coding phase has been a challenging week, with the decorator implementation and lazy loading. Hopefully I can fix these soon and move on to next problems.
I am grateful for the guidance and support provided by my mentor `Serge Koudoro <https://github.com/skoudoro>`__, and the DIPY community, which have been instrumental in driving this project forward.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to work on enhancing DIPY!

Thank you for reading!
